# 2nd Assignment
#### With each switch having a different tone, I settled on the idea of a piano! The LED lights are there for some extra fun. I attached a pen to a servo and had it move at an angle that will hit a bell.

#### - Took me a while to get how to use millis()
#### - The servo doesn't hit the bell hard enough for it to ring properly so i settled on a small angle (not good enough but did it's job)
