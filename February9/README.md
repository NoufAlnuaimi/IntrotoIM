# Intro to IM Third Assignment 
## Description 
#####  For the third assignment, I decided to use my art piece but make it a little more interactive. 
 ##### First change I made was color the background and give the "eyes" some "eyelids":

 ##### And then set it that once the mouse is pressed, the eyes open and the background changes color again:

 ##### Once i realized the colors gave me a headache, I changed them once again:

 ##### Mouse pressed:

 ##### For the "game" to be less confusing, I added a triangle that slightly miss-matched the triangles background.
 ##### Then I set-up the coins class and although it was a bit confusing at first, I went over the class notes and
 ##### watched youtube videos to help me along the process.

 ##### To fix the issue of the coins dropping down first thing, I used the mousePressed function to reduce it to when 
 ##### the mouse hovers over the miss-matched triangle, you win and it rains gold coins.
##### My piece

## Difficulties:
#### - Understanding the rotation of the lines.

## Things I learnt:
#### - Mistakes make for weirdly good results (the little traingles sun rays around the sun).
#### - Loops are a lot of fun and a lot easier to use.
