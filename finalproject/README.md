# Games Galore
### My Idea:
#### For this assignment, I decided to improve on week three's assignment and create a similar page on processing but this time with 2 different buttons that lead to three different game pages.
#### The three different games explained:
##### - The first one will have 2 or 3 levels where there are doors to "open" and those "doors" correspond to different patterns on the arduino LEDs and then the player will have 3 options to choose from. Picking the wrong option makes you lose 2 points and touching the walls makes you lose 1. When the player wins, the RGB LED on the arduino will light different colors!
##### - The second game will be a fruit catching game where the player controls the x-position of the basket using the potentiometer.

### First game:

#### What the player does:
##### -The player moves through the maze by controlling the little purple block using the keyboard cursers.
##### -Every time the player touches a wall, they lose a point from their score.
##### -Every time the player picks the wrong answer, they lose two points from their score.
#### Lost page:

##### -Once the player completes the maze, the RGB LED goes off like fireworks!

### Second game:

#### What the player does:
##### -For every red strawberry they catch, they get 1 point.
##### -For every pink strawberry they catch, it's 2 points.
##### -If they reach a score of 20, they've successfully made jam!

##### -If they catch a fly then they lose 10 points and yuck, they've made fly jam if the score goes below zero.
