# A Maze Game
### My Idea:
#### I decided to create a maze game because I thought I could easily incooperate all the requirements of the midterm project.
## February 18th:
#### I decided to first roughly sketch my idea and plan out all the little details I wanted to add like what images I wanted to use and what sounds. Then I watched videos to make sure I was actually capable of doing them as I am very new to programming and had never done it before this class.
##### The Sketch:

 #### When I started doing the maze walls, I realized the scale of what i sketched compared to the actual sketch was too small and I felt like my sketch was too big and I was actually unable to see the whole thing on my screen so I decided to scale it down for next time.
 ##### Example:

  ## February 22nd:
 #### I scaled it down to (1000,800) instead of (1000,1000) for a better size and so I can see the whole program on my screen. I also finished my maze walls and created the little "player" circle.
