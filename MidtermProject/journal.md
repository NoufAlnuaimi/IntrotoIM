# A Maze Game
### My Idea:
#### I decided to create a maze game because I thought I could easily incooperate all the requirements of the midterm project. The idea of the game is that you collect the clues from boxes and follow the clues to collect the rest of the correct boxes BUT every time you touch a wall you lose a "life" and each player has only 4 "lives". You lose the game when you lose them all. You win the game when you collect all and exit through the right path.
## February 18th:
#### I decided to first roughly sketch my idea and plan out all the little details I wanted to add like what images I wanted to use and what sounds. Then I watched videos to make sure I was actually capable of doing them as I am very new to programming and had never done it before this class.
##### The Sketch:

 #### When I started doing the maze walls, I realized the scale of what i sketched compared to the actual sketch was too small and I felt like my sketch was too big and I was actually unable to see the whole thing on my screen so I decided to scale it down for next time.
 ##### Example:

  ## February 22nd:
 #### I scaled it down to (1000,800) instead of (1000,1000) for a better size and so I can see the whole program on my screen. I also finished my maze walls and created the little "player" circle. I thought the one exit staretgy i went for in my sketch seemed too easy, so I instead decided to include several paths at the bottom that looked like the right paths and the player would only know which one to go for through the clues.

 #### Whilst doing that, I realized that using functions to draw shapes or such is a lot better than drawing the shapes themselves inside the draw function. When you create your own function, it is a lot neater thus a lot easire to navigate through when there is a mistake. 
 #### After being done with the maze walls, I watched a video about classes again just to grasp the idea of it and decided to create a class for my game's "start" page. I settled for a simple old video games look and the instructions typed out as a little typewriter one letter at a time.

 #### When I added the class into the main program; ready to do the whole mouseclicked to start the game,,,,this happened:

#### I had other assignments to tend to so I decided to fix this issue on the 23rd.
##### Other personal issues I had and need to work on for the sake of time: please, for the love of heavens, stop trying to resolve other issues whilst working on an issue already. I end up reading too many threads on processing to understand concepts I want to tackle when I havent even finished the concpet I'm working on.
## February 23rd:
#### I realized the silly mixtake I made with my code last night and so I fixed it.

### Plans for today:
#### - Put a mouseclicked function on the start button.
#### - Add the "lives" count.
#### - Understand how to use pixel colors to check of the player is touching a wall.
#### - Use that to make the number of lives decrease.
